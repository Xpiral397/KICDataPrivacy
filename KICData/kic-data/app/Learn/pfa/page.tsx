          <p>
          Phishing scams are deceptive tactics used by cybercriminals to trick individuals into divulging personal information, such as passwords, credit card details, or login credentials, through fraudulent emails, websites, or messages. In the realm of e-commerce, phishing scams often masquerade as legitimate communications from trusted brands, enticing users to click on malicious links, download attachments, or provide sensitive information under false pretenses. These scams may impersonate well-known e-commerce platforms, payment processors, or shipping companies, exploiting the familiarity and trust associated with these brands to deceive unsuspecting users.

              <span className="font-[700]">Verify the Sender</span>: 
              Before clicking on any links or downloading attachments from emails, verify the sender's identity and legitimacy. Be wary of emails from unknown or suspicious senders, as well as emails that contain spelling or grammatical errors, unexpected requests for personal information, or urgent calls to action.

            <li>
              <span className="font-[700]">Inspect URLs and Links</span>:Scrutinize URLs and hyperlinks in emails or messages carefully before clicking on them. Hover over links to reveal their destination URLs and ensure they match the expected domain of the sender. Be cautious of shortened URLs or URLs with misspellings or unusual characters, as these may redirect to fraudulent websites.

            </li>


            <li>
              <span className="font-[800]">Exercise Caution with Attachments</span>: Avoid downloading attachments or opening files from unsolicited or unexpected emails, especially if they prompt you to enable macros or execute scripts.

              <span className="font-[800]">Protect Personal Information</span>: Never provide sensitive information such as passwords, credit card details, or social security numbers in response to unsolicited requests or communications, regardless of how legitimate they may appear. Legitimate organizations will never ask you to disclose sensitive information via email or text message.
